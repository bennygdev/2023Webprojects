It generates a random name with a click of a button. You have various settings to choose from to decide on how you want the name to be genereated. This is mainly developed using Webpack and Node, as well as BabelJS to ensure compatatiblity with older browsers. This is friendly for all views (Web, Tablet, Mobile). <br>
